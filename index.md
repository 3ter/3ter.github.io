# OpenHPI Excercise Page on "Kuzco"

Kuzco is the main character and protagonist in The Emperor's New Groove, which happens to be one of the - if not the - favorite movie of mine. His character is a hyperbole of a monarch that solely thinks of himself.

## Character Traits

* selfish to a laughable degree
* dances like a demigod
* deeply into waterslides

> Don't tell me. We're about to go over a huge waterfall.
